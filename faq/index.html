        <h2>General Questions</h2>

        <h3>How can we get in touch with you?</h3>

        <p>While you can read more about UNIbrace on Facebook and follow us on Instagram the best way is via email at: <a href="mailto:info@unibrace.com">info@unibrace.com</a>. We do our best to answer emails in a timely fashion. </p>

        <h3>What is the UNIbrace Warranty?</h3>

        <p>UNIbrace products are warranted to be free of defects from materials and workmanship for a period of 1 year from original purchase. If the product fails to work during normal use, UNIbrace will repair or replace the defect at no charge. UNIbrace must perform the service. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@unibrace.com">info@unibrace.com</a> to initiate the return process.</p>

        <h3>How long does shipping take? </h3>

        <p>Continental US orders are shipped via UPS Ground Service. In normal weather conditions the expected shipping times are shown below. </p>
        
        <p><img src="../img/UNIbrace-ground-transit-estimate.png" class="img-responsive" /></p>
        
        <p>For International shipments, in some countries we use USPS Priority Mail, which takes 6-10 days. In other countries we use USPS Express Mail, which has 3-5 day service. In countries where the size of the product is larger than the delivery country postal services allows we use UPS Expedited Service. This is also a 3-5 day service. For international customers please note that there is customs clearance in addition to the shipping time.</p>

        <h3>Are there any customs duties that need to be paid on the arrival of my order</h3>

        <p>We currently ship to in excess of 37 countries. Each country has different customs regulations, so there is no answer that applies to all countries. If in doubt please check your country’s import duty requirements. </p>

        <h3>I’m in the San Francisco Area; can I pick up my order?</h3>

        <p>All of our products are produced in Washington State and must be shipped, therefore they cannot be picked up.</p>

        <h3>Do you give military discounts?</h3>

        <p>We try to help all of our customers and treat everyone equally, therefore there are no specific military discounts.</p>

        <h3>Your shipping costs to my country are expensive; can I use my own shipping service?</h3>

        <p>Yes, absolutely. We are a small company and don’t always get the best rates to countries where we cannot use USPS (Postal) Service. If you can get a better rate please contact UNIbrace at: <a href="mailto:info@unibrace.com">info@unibrace.com</a> and ask to be quoted rates for pickup in Washington state.</p> 

        <h3>When are you having your next sale?</h3>

        <p>We generally have sales a couple times per year, but do not pre announce sales or post them on Facebook. They are usually announced on enthusiast forum sites like <a href="http://www.golfmk6.com/" target="_blank">GolfMk6.com</a>. </p>

        <h3>Why do you use aluminum for your products? I thought steel was stronger?</h3>

        <p>Please refer to <a href="../philosophy/index.html">Our Philosophy</a> for a full explanation.</p>

        <h3>I’d like to start with one UNIbrace product, which one should I choose first?</h3>
        
        <p>This is a difficult question as there are many variables and tradeoffs. If you are looking for the maximum rigidity from one product then the UNIbrace XB/XBQ is your best choice. However, it does require an ~1.5 – 2 hour installation, drilling, and nutsert installation. If you are not confident to accomplish on your own or you do not know a competent installer, then I recommend the UNIbrace UB/UBQ as your first choice. If you have a MkV or MkVI car and it is FWD with IRS then the UNIbrace RB is a great compliment to add without any complicated installation using OEM attachment points. If you need clarification, please refer to our <a href="../installation/index.html">Installation</a> page.</p>
        <p>We would also recommend reading the <a href="../testimonials/index.html">Testimonials</a> page to see what other UNIbrace customers have to say about our products. The enthusiast community is the best source of information and we have copied some of the most pertinent links and reviews. </p>

        <h2>XB Series Questions</h2>

        <h3><span id="xb-nuserttool">Do I need to purchase the M8 HD nutsert installation tool?</span></h3>

        <p>You do not need to purchase the tool from us, but you absolutely need a proper M8 nutsert installation tool. Please DO NOT make a tool from a standard bolt and nuts. The vast majority of people who have had installation issues have been due to not using a proper tool. These tools, and other nutsert installation tools are made from hardened steel or have a means of getting a large amount of torque needed to set the nutsert properly. Homemade tools do not. We understand not wanting to spend extra money, but you will regret this choice!</p>

        <h3>I’m not sure which XB model I should purchase? </h3>

        <p>Please refer to our <a href="../compatibility/index.html">compatibility guide</a>. </p>

        <h3>Which installation guide is the best to use?</h3>
        
        <p>We have several XB Series installation guides. They fall into two categories: 1. Standard, which require interior panel removal and 2. Those that do not require the removal of the interior panels. Many customers ask which is the best to use? It really depends on your skill and how much time you have. We still recommend using the standard type installation where the interior panels are removed because they they give you more flexibility in brace placement to better avoid spot weld locations when drilling for the nutserts. With the panels removed you can better see all the spot welds and reposition the brace up or down as necessary. However, this method takes more time and requires more skill in removal and replacement of the interior panels. Either way, please take your time, and check your measurements before drilling. Always use a center punch to locate your holes and the best method is to start with one hole, get the nutsert installed and use the brace as a template to locate the next hole. Repeat this method for the third and fourth hole. Most importantly, follow the instructions.  </p>

        <h3>What is the additional cost for the Jetta/Bora specific UNIbrace XB models, what is the lead-time and why do they cost more? </h3>

        <p>The Jetta/Bora specific UNIbrace XB’s, model J/B4 (MkIV) and J/B5-6 (MkV/MkVI) are a US$25.00 upcharge to the standard braces as they are custom fabricated and take up to three weeks to fabricate (but usually faster). It really depends on where we are in a production cycle. The upcharge is because we do not keep these models in stock and the rivet holes and reinforcement tube must to be cut to different lengths to accommodate the Jetta/Bora pass-through to the trunk (boot). </p>

        <h3>I purchased a used UNIbrace XB or UNIbrace XBQ, but lost or did not have the hardware. Do you sell them?</h3>

        <p>Yes, please refer to the <a href="../tools-hardware/index.html">Tools/Hardware</a> page. This is to be used only when purchasing tools/hardware without a UNIbrace part order. If you are ordering another UNIbrace part and want to purchase tools/hardware, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:info@unibrace.com">info@unibrace.com</a>
        
        <h3>Can I use the UNIbrace XB Series braces as a harness bar?</h3>
        
        <p>We are often asked if this is possible. While it may look like this is OK we do not recommend attaching a harness because the brace is not designed as a harness anchoring device and loads the brace and its anchors in ways that it was not designed for. For safety’s sake please use an approved harness bar. </p>

        <h3>What are the UNIbrace XB/XB-3/XBQ hardware specifications?</h3>

        <p>All UNIbrace XB Series hardware is available on our <a href="../tools-hardware/index.html">Tools/Hardware</a> page or at <a href="http://www.mcmaster.com" target="_blank">http://www.mcmaster.com</a></p>

        <h2>UB Series Questions</h2>

        <h3>I’m not sure which UB model I should purchase?</h3>

        <p>Please refer to our <a href="../compatibility/index.html">compatibility guide</a>.</p>

        <h3><span id="ub-spacerkit">How do I know if I need to purchase the spacer/deep nut kit?</h3>

        <p>Generally the spacer/deep nut kit is required for aftermarket exhausts that have a 4” Ø, or larger, <i>resonator</i> <u>in the mid pipe area</u>. When in doubt please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@unibrace.com">info@unibrace.com</a> and we will do our best to assist you with your specific exhaust. Due to the tremendous range of products for 2008+ cars we may not be familiar with all manufacturers, specifically Non-US models, but we will do our best to guide you. When in doubt, especially for International orders, it is always safer to purchase the spacer/deep nut kit so it can be included in your order.</p>

        <h3>How do I know if I need to purchase the UNIbrace UBxlr instead of the UNIbrace UB?</h3>
        
        <p>The UNIbrace UBxlr model was specially designed for the MkVI Golf R with the APR turboback exhaust due to its HUGE resonator. The UNIbrace UBxlr and UNIbrace UB have the same profile and bolt pattern so they will fit the same car models. It may also be useful for custom exhausts with extra large resonators.</p>

        <h3>How much ground clearance do I loose with the UNIbrace UB/UBQ/UBxlr?</h3>

        <p>The UNIbrace UB and UNIbrace UBQ reduce clearance approximately 1.125” (28mm). The UNIbrace UBxlr does not reduce ground clearance as the APR RSC turboback hangs lower than the brace. </p>

        <h3>Will the UNIbrace UB fit TDI models? Do I need the Spacer/Deep Nut Kit? What about the UBQ for the Mk7 models?</h3>

        <p>For the Golf TDI we have been told by customers that the spacer/deep nut kit is necessary for the emissions equipment so we expect the Jetta is the same. However, for the Audi A3 TDI this does not seem to be the case. When in doubt, especially for International orders, it is always safer to purchase the spacer/deep nut kit so it can be included in your order. For the UNIbrace UBQ there are no additional spacers or hardware required and mounting holes are pre-drilled for the emissions equipment. </p>

        <h3>I purchased a used UNIbrace UB, but lost or did not have the hardware. Do you sell them?</h3>

        <p>Yes, please refer to the <a href="../tools-hardware/index.html">Tools/Hardware</a> tab at the top of the page. This is to be used only when purchasing tools/hardware without a UNIbrace part order. If you are ordering another UNIbrace part and want to purchase tools/hardware, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:info@unibrace.com">info@unibrace.com</a></p>

        <h3>Do I need to purchase the M8 HD nutsert installation tool for the UB-T?</h3>

        <p>You do not need to purchase the tool from us, but you absolutely need a proper M8 nutsert installation tool. Please <u>DO NOT</u> make a tool from a standard bolt and nuts. The vast majority of people who have had installation issues have been due to not using a proper tool. These tools, and other nutsert installation tools are made from hardened steel or have a means of getting a large amount of torque needed to set the nutsert properly. Homemade tools do not. We understand not wanting to spend extra money, but you will regret this choice!</p>

        <h3>Will the UNIbrace UB fit the Volkswagen R36 or Audi MkII TT 3.2?</h3>

        <p>Unfortunately the UNIbrace UB will not fit with the stock exhausts and their side-by-side catalytic converters even when using the spacer/deep nut kit. It will fit if you are using an aftermarket exhaust with a single catalytic converter less than 4” Ø resonator <u>in the mid pipe area</u>. For larger single catalytic converters please select the spacer/deep nut kit on the <a href="../tools-hardware/index.html">tools/hardware</a> page.</p>

        <h3>Will the UNIbrace UB-T fit the Audi MkII TTRS?</h3>

        <p>Yes, but not with the secondary catalytic converters. We also recommend selecting the TTRS hardware kit for this model and all 3” Ø or larger exhausts.</p>

        <h3>What is the UNIbrace UB hardware specification and what is the torque spec?</h3>

        <p>The Volkswagen OEM nuts are part number: N 907 611 01 M8 shouldered hex nuts. The nuts that are part of the spacer/deep nut kit are custom fabricated to work with the ¼”/7mm spacers and can be purchased on the <a href="../tools-hardware/index.html">tools/hardware</a> page. See <a href="../installation/index.html">installation</a> page for torque specification.</p>

        <h2>RB Series Questions</h2>

        <h3>Will the UNIbrace RB fit all exhausts?</h3>

<p>The current version of the UNIbrace RB will fit all exhausts that we are aware of. Our  current version is now the third revision of this product. The initial version was designed  around the APR and AWE 3” catbacks, however we still developed clearance issues with  both stock and some 3” catback exhausts. This was our most challenging product due to its  small size and tight location, further complicated by numerous aftermarket exhaust and  swaybar combinations. Based on customer feedback we corrected many exhaust problems  with version two, and are confident that with version three we have it dialed in perfectly.  Persistence paid off! Versions one and two will still fit APR and AWE 3” catback exhausts and <u>all</u> Jetta/Bora installations.</p>

        <h3>What is the UNIbrace RB hardware specification and what is the torque spec?</h3>

        <p>
          All Hardware Stainless Steel<br />
          2 – 1.4" M8 hex bolts w/ nuts, washers, and lock washers<br />
